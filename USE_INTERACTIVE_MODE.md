# ✅ Solution: Use Interactive Mode

## 🚫 OCR Mode Issue

OCR mode is blocked by OpenAI regional restrictions (403 error). This will require:
- VPN to supported region (US/EU/UK)
- OR different OpenAI account
- OR waiting for OpenAI to support your region

## ✅ Working Solution: Interactive Mode

**Interactive Mode works perfectly and doesn't need OpenAI!**

### How to Use:

1. **Disable the OCR toggle**
   - Make sure the toggle is GRAY (not purple)
   - It should say "Using standard visual search only"

2. **Upload your image**
   - The blue sweater image or any image

3. **Select items**
   - You'll see the interactive selection screen
   - Buttons will appear on the image
   - Click to select which items you want to search

4. **Search**
   - Click the search button
   - Results will appear!

### What Interactive Mode Does:

```

DINO-X Detection (finds items)

### Why This Works:
