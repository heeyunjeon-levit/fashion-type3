# âœ… Modal Deployment Success!

## Python Backend is Live

Your heavy ML backend (GroundingDINO + SAM-2) is now successfully deployed on Modal!

**Backend URL:** `https://heeyunjeon-levit--fashion-crop-api-fastapi-app.modal.run`

## What Just Happened

The deployment succeeded after fixing the file inclusion issue. The key was using Modal's `add_local_dir` and `add_local_file` methods to explicitly include all Python modules in the Docker image:

- `api/` - FastAPI server code
- `src/` - Core pipeline and analyzers
- `configs/` - Configuration files
- `crop_api.py` - Crop endpoint logic
- `custom_item_cropper.py` - ML model integration

## Next Steps to Make MVP Interactive

### 1. Set Environment Variable in Vercel

Go to your Vercel project settings and add:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_PYTHON_CROPPER_URL=https://heeyunjeon-levit--fashion-crop-api-fastapi-app.modal.run
```

### 2. Redeploy Frontend

The frontend will automatically redeploy when you push to GitHub, OR you can manually trigger a deployment in Vercel.

### 3. Test the Interactive MVP

Once the frontend is redeployed with the new environment variable, your MVP will be fully interactive!

Users will be able to:
1. Upload images
2. Select categories
3. Get cropped items (processed by Modal)
4. See product search results

## Deployment Files

- **`python_backend/modal_final.py`** - Working Modal deployment configuration
- Deployment command: `cd python_backend && modal deploy modal_final.py`

## Configuration

The Modal deployment uses:
- **2 CPUs** and **8GB RAM** - enough for the ML models
- **600 second timeout** - for long-running crop operations
- **Persistent volume** - for caching model weights

## Cost Considerations

Modal charges based on:
- Compute time (when the function is running)
- No charges when idle

This is much more cost-effective than keeping a server running 24/7!

## Monitoring

## Troubleshooting

If you need to redeploy:
```bash
cd /Users/levit/Desktop/mvp/python_backend
modal deploy modal_final.py
```

If you need to update secrets (API keys):
```bash
modal secret create fashion-api-keys \
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key \
  SUPABASE_URL=your_url \
  SUPABASE_KEY=your_key
```
