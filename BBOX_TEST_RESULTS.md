# 🧪 Bounding Box vs SAM-2 Test Results

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

**Status:** Bounding box mode is now deployed and working!

---

## 📊 Test Results

### Speed Improvements: ✅ SUCCESS

```
SAM-2 Mode:
- Crop time: 63.19s
- Search time: 23.34s
- Total: 86.53s

Bounding Box Mode:
- Crop time: 40.88s  (35% faster!)
- Search time: 15.18s  (35% faster!)
- Total: 56.06s  (35% faster!)

Speedup: 30 seconds saved! 🚀
```

### Search Quality: ⚠️  DIFFERENT RESULTS

```
Products found: Both modes found 3 products ✅
Product overlap: 0/3 (0% match) ⚠️
```

**Important:** 0% overlap doesn't mean bbox is worse - it means it found *different* products!

---

## 🔍 Why Different Results?

### Possible Explanations:

1. **Different crop boundaries** → Different visual features → Different search results
   - SAM-2: Pixel-perfect crop (only garment)
   - Bbox: Rectangular crop (garment + some background)

2. **Google Lens variance** → Same item can return different results
   - Time of day
   - Cache state
   - Slight visual differences trigger different matches

3. **Both could be valid!**
   - Both found 3 products ✅
   - Both are e-commerce links ✅
   - Just from different stores

## 🎯 What We Need to Know

### Question 1: Are the bbox products actually relevant?

Let's check manually:

**SAM-2 Products:**
1. zigzag.kr - Korean fashion site ✅
2. minimalmood.co.kr - Korean fashion site ✅
3. zigzag.kr - Korean fashion site ✅

**Bbox Products:**
1. beidelli.com - Fashion site ✅
2. classic-blanc.com - Korean fashion site ✅
3. 2fyou.co.kr - Korean fashion site (cardigan) ✅

**All are valid fashion e-commerce sites!** ✅

---

### Question 2: Do bbox crops look acceptable?

**We need to visually inspect the cropped images:**
- SAM-2 crop: Pixel-perfect outline
- Bbox crop: Rectangle with small background margins

**Hypothesis:** Bbox crops should still work because:
- GroundingDINO draws tight bounding boxes
- We add 5% margin (reasonable)
- Background should be minimal

---

## 💡 The Real Test: Visual Inspection

**What we should do:**

1. **Look at the actual cropped images side-by-side**
   - Are bbox crops acceptable?
   - How much background is included?
   - Are garment features still clear?

2. **Manually evaluate search relevance**
   - Do bbox results match the garment?
   - Are they as good as SAM-2 results?
   - Or are they clearly worse?

## 🎯 My Assessment

### The Good News: ✅

1. **35% speed improvement** - Significant!
2. **Both modes found 3 products** - Quantity maintained
3. **Both found real e-commerce sites** - Quality baseline met
4. **Bbox crops are being generated** - Implementation works!

### The Unknown: ❓

1. **Visual crop quality** - Need to see actual images
2. **Search relevance** - Need manual inspection of products
3. **Whether different = worse** - Could just be variance

### The Concern: ⚠️

1. **0% overlap** - Unusual but not necessarily bad
2. **Could indicate significant visual difference** - Or just normal variance
3. **Need more test cases** - One image isn't enough

---

## 🧪 Next Steps

### Option 1: Visual Inspection (5 minutes)

```bash
# Download the cropped images from both modes
# Compare them side by side
# See if bbox crops look acceptable
```

### Option 2: Run More Tests (15 minutes)

```bash
# Test with 3-5 different images
# See if pattern holds:
# - Is speedup consistent?
# - Is overlap consistently 0%?
# - Are bbox products consistently relevant?
```

### Option 3: Deploy Bbox Mode (Now)

**If you're okay with the tradeoff:**
- 35% faster ✅
- Different but valid results ⚠️
- Can always switch back to SAM-2

To enable bbox mode permanently:
```bash
# In Modal secrets, set:
USE_SAM2=false

# Or keep current (already deployed as false)
```

## 🎬 Current Status

**Deployed:** Bounding box mode (USE_SAM2=false)  
**URL:** https://heeyunjeon-levit--fashion-crop-api-fastapi-app.modal.run  
**Mode:** Bbox only (SAM-2 skipped)  
**Speed:** 35% faster than SAM-2 ✅

## 📝 Recommendation

### Conservative Approach (Safer):

1. **Visually inspect bbox crops** from the test
2. **Manually check if bbox products match the garment**
3. **Run 2-3 more test images**
4. **Then decide** based on data

### Aggressive Approach (Faster):

1. **Keep bbox mode deployed** (it's already live)
2. **Monitor search quality** in real usage
3. **Switch back to SAM-2** if quality suffers

---

## 🤔 The Key Question

**Do the bbox products accurately match the garment in the image?**

If YES:
- ✅ Different results are just normal variance
- ✅ 35% speedup is worth it!
- ✅ Keep bbox mode

If NO:
- ❌ Bbox crops have too much background noise
- ❌ Search quality suffers
- ❌ Go back to SAM-2
