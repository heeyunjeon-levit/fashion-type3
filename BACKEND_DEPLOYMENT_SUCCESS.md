# ‚úÖ Backend Deployment Complete!

## üéâ Your ML Backend is Fully Operational!

**Backend URL:** `https://heeyunjeon-levit--fashion-crop-api-fastapi-app.modal.run`

**Status:** `cropper_available: true` ‚úÖ

---

## What's Working

‚úÖ **GroundingDINO** - Object detection model loaded  
‚úÖ **SAM-2** - Segmentation model loaded  
‚úÖ **Model weights** - All 500MB+ of weights included in the image  
‚úÖ **OpenGL libraries** - Required system dependencies installed  
‚úÖ **FastAPI server** - Responding on Modal infrastructure  
‚úÖ **CORS configured** - Ready to accept requests from your Next.js frontend  

---

## Issues Fixed During Deployment

1. **Import path issues** - Fixed `GroundingDINO` vs `groundingdino` import conflicts
2. **Missing OpenGL library** - Added `libgl1-mesa-glx` and `libglib2.0-0` 
3. **SAM-2 not installed** - Added SAM-2 installation from GitHub
4. **Volume mount conflict** - Switched to baking weights directly into the image
5. **PyTorch version conflicts** - SAM-2 required PyTorch 2.9.0 (upgraded from 2.2.0)

---

## Final Configuration

**Deployment:** Modal (ML-optimized infrastructure)  
**CPU:** 2 cores  
**Memory:** 16GB RAM  
**Timeout:** 600 seconds (10 minutes)  
**Python:** 3.10  
**PyTorch:** 2.9.0 (with CUDA 12.8 support)  

**Model Files Included:**
- `groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth` (~500MB)
- `sam2_hiera_large.pt` (~800MB)
- Config files for both models

## Next Steps to Make Your MVP Interactive

### 1. Set Environment Variable in Vercel

Go to your Vercel project settings and add:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_PYTHON_CROPPER_URL=https://heeyunjeon-levit--fashion-crop-api-fastapi-app.modal.run
```

**How to set it:**
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project (`mvp`)
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
4. Add the variable above
5. Click **Save**

### 2. Redeploy Your Frontend

Your frontend code already uses this environment variable (in `app/components/Cropping.tsx`):

```typescript
const PYTHON_CROPPER_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PYTHON_CROPPER_URL || 'http://localhost:8000'
```

After setting the environment variable, Vercel will automatically redeploy. Or you can manually trigger a redeploy from the Vercel dashboard.

### 3. Test Your Interactive MVP

Once the frontend is redeployed:

1. Go to your Vercel URL
2. Upload an image
3. Select categories (e.g., "ÏÉÅÏùò √ó2", "ÌïòÏùò √ó1")
4. Click crop
5. **The backend will now actually crop the items!** (not mock mode)
6. You'll get 3 product links with thumbnails for each cropped item

## Monitoring and Debugging

**View Modal logs:**
```bash
cd /Users/levit/Desktop/mvp/python_backend
modal app logs fashion-crop-api
```

**Test the backend directly:**
```bash
curl https://heeyunjeon-levit--fashion-crop-api-fastapi-app.modal.run/
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "online",
  "cropper_available": true,
  "endpoint": "/crop"
}
```

**Test a crop request:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://heeyunjeon-levit--fashion-crop-api-fastapi-app.modal.run/crop \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "imageUrl": "YOUR_IMAGE_URL",
    "categories": ["tops"],
    "count": 1
  }'
```

## Cost Estimates (Modal)

Modal charges for compute time:

- **Cold start:** First request after idle takes ~30-60 seconds (model loading)
- **Warm requests:** ~5-15 seconds per crop
- **Idle timeout:** Containers shut down after inactivity
- **Cost:** ~$0.50-1.00 per hour of active compute time (2 CPU + 16GB RAM)

For your MVP usage (probably <100 requests/day), this should be **$1-5/month**.
